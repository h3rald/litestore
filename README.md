LiteStore is a lightweight, self-contained, RESTful, multi-format NoSQL document store server written in [Nim](http://www.nim-lang.org) and powered by a [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org) backend for storage. It aims to be a very simple and lightweight backend ideal for prototyping and testing REST APIs and single-page applications.
